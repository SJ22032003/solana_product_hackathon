## Understanding The Problem
Checking the Solana portfolio can be too
complicated with present-day tools and may not be
understandable by most people.
We aim to solve this problem by simplifying the
interface between the interface between the user
and the database

## Solution
TracSolana basically works On UI between solana ecosystem and user.
It Gives the user an easy to use webApp interface.
The sign in process based on JSON architecture. It's easy to sign in just
you have to enter your solana address.
After you have enter your address they verify your account (by using moralis
SDK),then your solana account show your:
Solana balance
NFT Metadata
